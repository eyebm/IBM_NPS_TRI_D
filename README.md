Tri-d script and instructions below.
 
1)	Please create a new empty directory on your Netezza host called "trid".
2) Copy the attached file, tri-d.tar-rw.gz, into the new "trid" directory.
3) Then, run the following two commands to extract and run the Tri-Dimensional Analysis collection scripts:

tar xvzf tri-d.tar-rw.gz or tar -xvzf filename.gz

./runtrid.sh
It may take a few minutes for the script to run. When the script completes, it will create an output file, trid_output.zip. Please send us this output, and then you may delete the "trid" directory with the collection scripts and output.
